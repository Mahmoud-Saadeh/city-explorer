**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This website allows users to explore any location by typing the location name in the input field and as a result, the Lat and the Long will be displayed with a map of that location and you can zoom in and out.

## Getting Started

Used Libraries
    - React
    - Axios
    - Bootstrap
I also used locationiq API, so first signup and copy your key, and put it inside an env file.

## Architecture

for the design, I only used Bootstrap library and some CSS.
